# Simple Solidity Project

This is a basic GitHub repository demonstrating a simple Solidity smart contract written in Ethereum's Solidity language. The contract is a basic "Hello World" example that can be deployed on the Ethereum blockchain or tested in a development environment like Remix or Hardhat.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (for testing, if using Hardhat)
- Solidity compiler (e.g., via Remix IDE or solc)
- Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask) for deployment

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple-solidity-project.git
text2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd simple-solidity-project
text### Usage
- The main contract is in `HelloWorld.sol`.
- Compile and deploy using Remix IDE: Open `HelloWorld.sol` in [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/).
- Call the `greet()` function to get the "Hello, World!" message.

### Testing
You can test the contract using Hardhat:
1. Install dependencies:
npm install
text2. Run tests (if test files are added).
